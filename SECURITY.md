# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

We take the security of the OWASP Web3 Wallet Security project seriously.  
This repository contains documentation, standards, and guidance related to Web3 wallet security.

If you believe you have identified a security issue related to this repository itself (for example, repository configuration, website deployment, or automation workflows), we appreciate responsible disclosure.

## How to Report

Please report security-related issues by contacting the OWASP Security Team at:

https://owasp.org/www-project-web3-wallet-security/contact/


Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Any relevant context or reproduction steps
- Potential impact, if known

Please **do not** use public GitHub issues to report sensitive security matters.

## Scope

This project does not operate, deploy, or maintain Web3 wallets, smart contracts, protocols, or production systems.  
Security issues affecting third-party wallets, applications, or blockchain networks should be reported directly to the appropriate maintainers or vendors.

Thank you for helping keep OWASP projects secure.
